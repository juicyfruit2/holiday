# holiday

Follow these steps:
- Create a Python file called holiday.py in your folder.
- You will need to create four functions:
- hotel_cost — This function will take the number of nights a user will be staying at a hotel as an argument, and return a total cost for the hotel stay (You can choose the price per night charged at the hotel).
- plane_cost — This function will take the city you are flying to as an argument and return a cost for the flight (Hint: use if/else if statements in the function to retrieve a price based on the chosen city).
- car_rental — This function will take the number of days the car will be hired for as an argument and return the total cost of the car rental.
- holiday_cost — This function will take three arguments: the number of nights a user will be staying in a hotel, the city the user will be flying to, and the number of days that the user will be hiring a car for. Using these three arguments, you can call all three of the above functions with respective arguments and finally return a total cost for your holiday.
- Print out all the details about the holiday in a meaningful way!
- Try using your program with different combinations of input to show its compatibility with different options.
